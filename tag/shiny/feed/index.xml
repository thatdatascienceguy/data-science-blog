<p>Hello World!</p>



<p>Ever dreamed of what to name your future children or curious how popular a particular name is? Love interactive web apps?</p>



<p><strong>Well say no more!</strong></p>



<p>That Data Science Guy here and this blog post will be based on a web app I made using R Shiny. The web app allows you to type in a name and gender and see how many babies were born from 1880-2018 via bar plot. </p>



<p>When using the app, always type the name of the person with the first letter capitalized. Otherwise, you might get a empty result.</p>



<p>With that said, check it out! Type in some names, have fun and you just might find some interesting results and trends! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure><iframe loading="lazy" width="110%" height="700px" src="https://thatdatascienceguy.shinyapps.io/BabyNamesApp/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p>The data comes from &#8216;babynames&#8217; package in the programming language R. This dataset has a list of baby names of people born in the United States from 1880 to 2018 and comes from the United States SSA (Social Security Administration).</p>



<p><strong>*** Please note for safety reasons, names that were used less than 5 times are omitted.***</strong></p>



<p>Hope you enjoyed my web app and hope you learned something new!!</p>

<p>Hello world! Time to play ball!!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>I was looking into baseball statistics and always wanted to look into baseball statistics especially historical data. Baseball is not only considered by some to be America&#8217;s pastime, but also one of the most statistical sports in the world. </p>



<p>I came across the Lahman Baseball database: <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/</a> created by Author and Journalist Sean Lahman which has MLB records of baseball games dating all the way back to 1871. I decided to use the statistical programming language R and Shiny, a R package which one can create interactive web apps.</p>



<p>The app below allows you to enter a baseball player&#8217;s first and last name and what kind of data you want to look at. Data is available from 1871 up to 2019. (post season is not included) Available options are</p>



<ul><li>fielding</li><li>batting</li><li>pitching</li></ul>



<p>For each choice you select, you&#8217;ll see the selected baseball player&#8217;s stats at the bottom. </p>



<p>Also, for each position you select, you can also select the statistic you want to plot. This will create a bar plot of year vs the statistic you selected.</p>



<p>Check out the app! Learn about baseball player stats and how they were throughout their career. If you want to have baseball conversations and/or debates, pull up this app; it&#8217;ll definitely be something to talk about and share with other people.</p>



<p>Last but not least, I want to give a big thanks and shout out to the man himself Sean Lahman for making this data available and free to download. I would not have been able to make the app if it wasn&#8217;t for him and his work. Thanks Sean.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that the app will disconnect if you are not using if after about 15 minutes. Refresh your browser and the app should come up.</strong></p>
